[GitHub and Git](https://github.com/SeattleTestbed/docs/blob/master/Archive/Local/RepoAccess.md)

### Forking and Branching

The lab's general workflow for contributing to a project involves:
- Forking the repository
- Creating a branch on your fork related to the particular feature you wish to add, with an expressive name (e.g. no "feature1", but instead "secure_client_using_xyzlib")
- Make commits to that branch in accord with the commit guidelines below.
- Make a pull request (PR) on GitHub to pull your branch on your fork into the main repository's main branch.
- Request review for that PR.


### Commits: how to split them up, how to write good commit messages
#### Commit Messages
Good commit messages are an invaluable tool for understanding the history of a
repository and will also help your project look professional. Good messages
also allow others to taste the soup while it's cooking.
